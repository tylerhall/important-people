Important People
================

This script grabs a set of Twitter search results and retrieves the author's follower and update counts. Results are color coded and can be downloaded as a CSV.

BTW: I wrote this in about half an hour, so there's very little (read: no) error checking. If the fail whale were to rear it's ugly head, bad things may happen.

Based on an idea from [@mulls](http://twitter.com/mulls).
